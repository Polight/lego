# ðŸš€ LEGO Web Components, the Native and Future-Proof Web Components Library

LEGO is a Web Component library that allows you to build HTML elements easily and compile them to native HTML elements. The whole library runs within the browser.

Here is an example of LEGO component:

```html
<template>
  <p>Welcome to LEGO, the Native and ${duration} Web Components Library.</p>
</template>

<script>
  export default class extends Lego {
    state = { duration: 'Future-Proof' }
  }
</script>
```

To know more, go to [the documentation](https://lego.js.org/) to install and create native Web Components using LEGO.
