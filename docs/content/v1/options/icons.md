Icons are part of the [Meteor Icons](https://meteoricons.com/) package and can be added to titles in the elements that make up the sidebar menu. They are not mandatory, but can help your readers easily identify the content of your documentation.

## Usage

To add an icon, simply add the `icon` attribute with the name of the icon that you can obtain from [Meteor Icons](https://meteoricons.com/). For example:

```markdown
---
title: My Page
icon: deviantart
---

Page content
```

All elements of the sidebar menu can have an icon, including deeper level items. However, I recommend using them only at the top level to avoid confusion for your readers.
