## Usage of Lego web-components

A web-component can optionally have 3 parts: some HTML in a `<template>` tag, some JavaScript
in a `<script>` tag and some CSS in a `<style>` tag.

You can make a web-component for multiple reasons.

If you just want to re-use a piece of HTML, the `<template>`
tag is all you need.

If you want to polish it's look {{< emoji "ðŸ’…" >}}, `<style>` is your friend.
Bonus: it's fully scoped with no leaking out of context.

When some user interaction or reactivity is demanded, `<script>`
is going to be the guy.
