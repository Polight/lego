title: Template Tag

An HTML content is written within a `<template>` tag.
It's just basic HTML augmented with a little of superpowers {{< emoji "ðŸ¦¸" >}}.

Let's call these superpowers **"directives"**.
You may easily detect them as they are prefixed with `:` or `@`.

With LEGO, there are only 4 directives to know:

- [`:if`]({{< relref "if" >}}) to display a tag based on a condition,
- [`:for`]({{< relref "for" >}}) to repeat a tag,
- [`:`]({{< relref "custom-directive" >}}) to evaluate a string,
- [`@`]({{< relref "event" >}}) to bind an event.

Note that `:if` and `:for` attributes, when used in the same tag should be used with an order in mind:

```html
<a :if="user" :for="user in state.users"></a>
<!-- Won't work -->

<a :if="state.users.length" :for="user in state.users"></a>
<!-- Will first evaluate if the `users` array has items -->

<a :for="user in users" :if="user"></a>
<!-- Will check that each individual user has a value -->

<a :if="state.isAdmin" :for="user in state.users"></a>
<!-- Won't loop at all if `isAdmin` is false -->
```
