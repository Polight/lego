#### Component Attributes

Attributes declared on the components will be all be accessible through the `state`.
If the property is initialized in the `this.state`, the attribute will be reactive.

Example:

__index.html__
```html
<x-user status="Thinking 🤔"></x-user>
```

__bricks/x-user.html__
```html
<script>
  const state = { status: "Happy 😄" }
</script>

<template>
  <p>User status: {{ state.status }}</p>
</template>
```

`status` will therefore be reactive and the _Thinking 🤔_ attribute value will overwrite the _Happy 😄_ default status.

⚠️ A property that is not declared in the `state` won't be reactive.

These properties can be accessed through `this.getAttribute()` from within the component.
After all, these components are just native! 🏡
