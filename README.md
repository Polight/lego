# LEGO: Modern Web-Components

LEGO (_Lightweight Embedded Gluten-free Objects_) is a NodeJS tool to build üöÄ fast, ‚ôªÔ∏è reactive, üè° **native web-component** [bricks](https://github.com/polight/brick) that are easy to digest üå± for your browser.

Lego is inspired from the [native Web-Component spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) and some other libraries such as [Pureact](https://github.com/irony/pureact/) or [Riot](https://riot.js.org/).

It's just **much lighter** with simplicity, source that are easy to read, hack and maintain.

Lego uses [Brick](https://github.com/polight/brick) to generate web-components. In Brick you would write JS and virtual-dom by hand. With lego you write HTML and CSS components in HTML files.

It will transform your HTML in [Brick](https://github.com/polight/brick) classes run directly in your browser.


Demo: [view in action](https://lego.js.org/demo/) ‚Äì [checkout the source](https://github.com/Polight/lego/tree/master/demo/bricks)


## Installation

Lego is based on [npm](npmjs.com) and latest [node](https://nodejs.org/).

You should install the package from your project folder:
```
npm i @polight/lego
```

That's pretty much it!


## Quick start

## Hello World

Create a file called __bricks/hello-world.html__:

```html
<template>
  <p>Hello ${state.name}</p>
</template>

<script>
  init() { this.state = { name: "World!" } }
</script>
```

Compile with `npx lego bricks`

And use it in your __index.html__

```html
<script src="./dist/index.js" type="module"></script>
<hello-world />
```

#### Explanation

`npx lego bricks` created _dist/hello-world.js_. Checkout that basic JS file, that's a simple [Brick](https://github.com/polight/brick) instance that looks like:

```js
class HelloWorld extends Component {
  init() { this.state = { name: "World!" } }
  get vdom() {
    return ({ state }) => h('p', {}, `Hello ${state.name}`)
  }
}
customElement.define('hello-world', HelloWorkd)
```

You don't need to understand this but if you want to know more, view [how Brick works](https://github.com/Polight/brick#getting-started).

### Reactive Advanced Web-Component Example

__bricks/user-profile.html__

```html
<template>
  <h1>${state.firstName} ${state.lastName}'s profile</h1>
  <p>Welcome ${state.firstName}!</p>
  <h3 :if="state.favorites.length">You favorite fruits:</h3>
  <p :for="fruit in state.favorites">${fruit.name} ${fruit.icon}</p>
  <button :if="!state.registered" @click="register">Register now</button>
</template>

<script>
  init() {
    this.state = {
      registered: false,
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      favorites: [{ name: 'Apple', icon: 'üçé' }, { name: 'Pineapple', icon: 'üçç' }]
    }
  }

  register() {
    this.state.registered = confirm('Do you want to register?')
  }
</script>
```

Compile this component: `npx lego ./bricks ./dist`

### Then include it in your page:

_index.html_

```html
<user-profile></user-profile>
<script src="./dist/index.js" type="module"></script>
```

Run your page directly in your browser!


> When developing you may want to automatically watch files changes.
> In that case pass the `-w` flag: `npx lego -w ./bricks ./dist`

> Tip: you probably want to store this task with a shortcut like `npm run watch`.
> To do so just add `"watch": "lego -w ./bricks ./dist"` in you _package.json_ scripts.


## Understanding Webcomponents

A component can optionally have 3 parts: some HTML in a `<template>` tag, some JavaScript
in a `<script>` tag and some CSS in a `<style>` tag.

### Template tag

A template is written within a `<template>` tag.

It's just HTML with some empowerments for reactiveness.

These superpowers can be recognized with their `:` or `@` prefixes.

The possible directives are:

- `:if` to display a tag based on a condition
- `:for` to repeat a tag
- `:` to evaluate a string
- `@` to bind an event

> Note that `:if` and `:for` attributes, when used in the same tag should be used
> with an order in mind: `<a :if="user" :for="user in state.users">` won't work!
>
> `<a :for="user in users" :if="user">` will work as expected.
>
> You may want to use `:if` before `:for` when you want the loop to happen _if_
> a condition is met before.
>
> `<a :if="state.isAdmin" :for="user in state.users">` won't loop at all for non admin.

#### `:if` Directive

Conditionally display a tag and its descendants.

Example: `<p :if="state.count < 5">Less than 5</p>` will be displayed if the condition is met.

#### `:for` Directive

Repeat a tag based on a property.

The syntax is as follow: `:for="item in state.items"`.
The _item_ value will be available trough `${item}` within the loop.

If you need an incremental index `i`, use `:for="item, i in state.items"`.

Example: `<li :for="attendee in state.attendees">${attendee}</li>` with a state as
`this.state = { attendees: ['John', 'Mary'] }` will display `<li>John</li><li>Mary</li>`

#### `:` Custom Directive

A custom directive will interpret in JS whatever you pass as value.

```html
<template>
  <a :href="this.getUrl('144')">Visit Profile</a>
</template>
<script>
  getUrl(id) { return `/user/${id}` }
</script>
```

outputs

```
<a href="/user/144">Visit Profile</a>
```

[Boolean attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#sec-boolean-attributes)

Example: `<input type=checkbox :checked="state.agreed" :required="state.mustAgree">`.
With the following state: `this.state = { agreed: false, mustAgree: true }` would render
`<input type=checkbox required="required">`.

#### `@` Directive for binding Events

```html
<template>
  <button @click="sayHi" name="the button">click</button>

<script>
  sayHi(event) {
    alert(`${event.target.getAttribute('name')} says hi! üëãüèº`)
  }
</script>
```

#### Reactive Properties

The `state` is where the reactiveness takes place.

declare a `state` object in the `init()` function with default values:

```js
init() {
  this.state = {
    user: { firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Doe' },
    status: "Happy üòÑ"
  }
}
```

Whenever `registered`, `user`, or some `user` property will change, the component will be automagically updated!

Displaying a _state_ value is as simple as writing `${state.theValue}` in your HTML.

#### Component Attributes

Attributes declared on the components will be all be accessible through the `state`.
If the property is initialized in the `this.state`, the attribute will be reactive:

```html
<x-user status="thinking ü§î"><x-user>
```

`status` will therefore be reactive and the _thinking ü§î_ attribute value will overwrite the _Happy üòÑ_ default status.

A property that is not declared in the `state` won't be reactive.
It can be accessed through `this.getAttribute()`.
sAfter all, don't forget that these components are native! üè°


#### Slots

[Slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) are part of the
native web-component.
Because Lego builds native web-components, you can use the standard _slots_ as documented.

Example:

__index.html__
```html
<user-profile>
  <span>This user is in Paris</span>
<user-profile>
```

__bricks/user-profile.html__
```html
<template>
  <h1>User profile</h1>
  <p>important information: <slot></slot></p>
</template>
```

Will write `‚Ä¶<p>important information: <span>This user is in Paris</span></p>`

[See more advanced examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#Adding_flexibility_with_slots).


### Reactive CSS Style

CSS is much more fun when it's scoped.
Here it come with the web-components.

Here again, no trick, just the full power of web-components and scoping styles.
Well, you should know that the css is reactive too! üò≤

Writing CSS is as easy as

```html
<template>
  <h1>Bonjour!</h1>
</template>

<script>
  init() {
    this.state = { fontScale: 1 }
  }
</script>

<style>
  :host {
    font-size: ${state.fontScale}rem;
  }
  h1 {
    padding: 1rem;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

#### Host

[`:host` is a native selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host())
for web-components.
It allows to select the current component itself.

#### Variables

You can use variables in your CSS just like in your templates.

Example:
```html
<template>
  <h1>Bonjour<h1>
</template>
<script>
  this.state.color = '#357';
</script>
<style>
  h1 {
    color: ${ this.color };
  }
</style>
```

will apply the `#357` color onto `h1`.


## Compiling

```sh
npx lego <source_path> <target_file_path>
```

Would compile the _source_path_ file or folder (recursively) into _target_file_path_ js file.

As mentioned before, when developing you probably want to watch for changes with the `-w`
option: `npx lego -w <source_path> <target_file_path>`


**source_path**: either a file or a directory (relative or absolute). If it's a directory, it will recursively read all the _.html_ files and compile them into the _target_file_.

**target_file_path**: (default: _components.js_) the path (relative or absolute) to a _.js_ file.
That file will be created and contain all the components.


## Naming a Component

The name of the file will be the name of the component.

Example: _components/x-button.html_ will create `<x-button>` component.

## Using a Component as a Module

Importing external libraries is made easily possible with modules.
Lego offers a shorthand writing by default that don't permit importing
script by default.
However you can easily break off the shorthand and use explicit writing.

In order to do that, you need the following parts:
- `<script type="module">` to declare a module writing
- `import { Component } from 'https://unpkg.com/@polight/brick/lib'` to extend the `Component` class
- `class MyComponentName extends Component` for a component called `my-component-name` in a file called `my-component-name.html`

The rest of the documentation applies to modules as they do for shorthand script writing.

__x-button.html__

```html
<template>
  <button @click="toggleText">${state.text}</button>
</template>

<script type="module">
  import { Component } from 'https://unpkg.com/@polight/brick/lib'
  import { myFunction } from 'my/library/file.js'

  class XButton extends Component {
    init () { this.state = { text: "button says hello" } }

    toggleText() {
      this.state.text = myFunction("You clicked me!")
    }
  }
</script>
```

## Caveats and Gotchas

### Naming a Component

Because it builds native web-components, the naming convention must respect
[the ones from the standards](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/#valid-custom-element-name) (lowercase, with a dash in the name, starting with a letter, ‚Ä¶)


## Testing

## Running tests [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Polight/lego.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Polight/lego)

Just install node dev dependencies (`npm install`) and run the tests (`npm test`).


## Under the hood


### Native web-components

Because Lego is actual native web-components, all its native possibilities (like [slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#Adding_flexibility_with_slots)),
[:host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host)
and whatever exists or will exist are on board.


### Browser compatibility

Lego is based on native _customElements_.
[Support for customElement is spreading](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) and
shall increase in time.

When building a web-app you may have control of the browsers.
If you're building a more general website you may need to increase the overall browser
compatibility and install the [custom-element polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements).


### Dependencies

It is still fully compatible with native _custom elements_. No magic behind the scene,
no complexity, just a couple of useful methods to write native web-components easier.

Using a compiled component has no dependency, nothing extra injected in the browser.
Compiling depends on [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom).
