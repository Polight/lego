# LEGO: Modern Web-Components


LEGO (_Lightweight Embedded Gluten-free Objects_) is a thin layer to build web-component bricks that are easy to digest for your browser.

Lego is inspired from great libraries such as [Riot](https://riot.js.org/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) or [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/). It's just much lighter with no complexity, easier to read code, maintain and interact with the source.

[Demo](https://lego.js.org/demo/index.html)


## Install

The compiler can be installed via a simple command:

```sh
npm install @polight/lego
```

That will permit to compile your components.
See the [Compiling section](#Compiling) for further info.


## Quick start

Create an element:

__components/user-profile.html__

```html
<template>
  <h1>${ this.firstName } ${ this.lastName }'s profile</h1>
  <p>Welcome ${ this.firstName }!</p>
  <p :if="this.registered">You are fully registered</p>
  <button :if="!this.registered" on:click="this.register">Register now</button>
</template>

<script>
  this.setState({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    registered: false
  })

  this.register = () => {
    this.state.registered = true
    this.render()  // update the interface
  }
</script>
```

Then include it in your page:

_index.html_

```html
<user-profile></user-profile>
<script src="./dist.js" type="module"></script>
```

> Notice that you don't need to include Lego script in your index.html file.

Now you need to compile your components into a js file:

```sh
npx lego ./components/ ./dist.js
```

That will read all HTML components from the _./components_ folder and sub-folders and
create a _dist.js_ file.

> When developing you may want to automatically watch files changes.
> In that case pass the `-w` flag: `npx lego -w ./components/ ./dist.js`

> Trick: you probably want to store this task with a shortcut like `npm run watch`.
> To do so just add `"watch": "lego -w ./components/ ./dist.js"` in you _package.json_ scripts.


## Writing a component

A component can optionnaly have 3 parts: some HTML in a `<template>` tag, some JavaScript
in a `<script>` tag and some CSS in a `<style>` tag.

### Template tag

A template is written within a `<template>` tag.

It's just HTML with some empowerments for reactiveness.

These superpowers can be recognized with their `:` prefix.

> Note that these tags are interpreted and removed. You can't read them with CSS or script.

#### `:if`

Conditionally display a tag and its descendants.

Example: `<p :if="this.state.count < 5">Less than 5</p>` will be displayed if the condition is met.

#### `:for`

Repeat a tag reading from a variable.
The syntax is as follow: `:for="item in this.state.items"`.
The _item_ value will be available trough `this.item` within the loop.

Example: `<li :for="attendee in this.state.attendees">${ this.attendee }</li>` with a state as
`this.setState({ attendees: ['John', 'Mary'] })` will display `<li>John</li><li>Mary</li>`

#### Boolean attributes

[Boolean attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#sec-boolean-attributes)
like `required`, `checked`, `selected`, `disabled`, … are interpreted with a simple `:` prefix.

Example: `<input type=checkbox :checked="this.state.agreed" :required="this.state.mustAgree">`.
With the following state: `this.setState({ agreed: false, mustAgree: true })` would render
`<input type=checkbox required="required">`.

#### Object attributes

When passing complex object as attributes, such as objects themselves, arrays, classes, function…
you should set the value explicitely with literal string:

```html
<x-element user="${ this.user }" />

<script>
  class User {
    get fullName() { return 'John Doe' }
  }
  this.setState({ user: new User() })
</script>
```

#### Event listener

An event can be attached to a _DOM_ element with the prefix `on:` and the event name.

Example: `<button on:click="this.clicked">Click me</button>` will call the `this.clicked`
method in the component.

#### Reactive components

When changing an attribute you may want the component to be updated automatically.

In order to listen to the attribute, you can simply declare it as an attribute of your `<template>` tag:

```html
<template firstname="John" lastname="Doe" age="42">
  <h1>Welcome ${ this.firstname } ${ this.lastname }</h1>
</template>
```

This will:

- listen to changes on the 3 attributes _firstname_, _lastname_ and _age_.
- declare the default values for each of your attributes into your state.

Note that these default values will be available for your script into the _state_:

```js
console.log(this.state.age) // 42
```

> When compiling, the attributes values are evaluated whenever possible.
> In the current example "42" will become a Number. You could therefore pass
> `kids="['Brice', 'Kelly']"` and retrieve an array of 2 kids.


#### Slots

[Slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) are part of the
native web-component.
Because Lego build native web-components, you can use the standard _slots_.

Example:

__index.html__
```html
<user-profile>
  <span>This user is in Paris</span>
<user-profile>
```

__components/user-profile.html__
```html
<template>
  <h1>User profile</h1>
  <p>important information: <slot></slot></p>
</template>
```

Will write `…<p>important information: <span>This user is in Paris</span></p>`

[See more advanced examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#Adding_flexibility_with_slots).


### Script tag

The `<script>` tag contains HTML that will be injected into the component on initialisation.

It can provide information to the template via the `state` object.
Example: `this.state.userName = 'John'` will permit to render `<p>Hello ${ this.userName }</p>`.


#### Rendering

_Rendering_ is calculating the template tag and displaying it.
It is processed with the `render()` method.

Most of the time when you change the `state`, you probably then want to call `this.render()`
in order to update your HTML with the new `state` value(s).

Note that you can also pass the state as an object to the `render` method:
`this.render({ userName: 'John' })`.

In other words, calling `this.render()` is the way to update your component!


#### Binding event methods

`on:eventName` will bind the _eventName_ to the _DOM_ object and trigger the method.

In most cases you will want to bind that event with a call to a script function.

Example:

```html
<template>
  <button on:click="this.clicked">Click me</button>
</template>
<script>
  this.clicked = () => {
    alert('you clicked the button!')
  }
</script>
```

The events are native HTML. Meaning you can call `on:click`, `on:change`, `on:submit`, …

Behind the scene, it creates an `addEventListener(eventName)`, meaning you can use the
native browser debug, remove events and play with the full power of native events!


### Style tag

CSS is much more fun when it's scoped.
Here it come with the web-components.

Here again, no trick or magic, though the full power of web-components and scoping.

Writing CSS is as easy as

```html
<template>
  <h1>Bonjour!</h1>
</template>
<style>
  h1 {
    padding: 1rem;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

#### Host

[`:host` is a native selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host())
for web-components.
It allows to select the current component itself.

#### Variables

You can use variables in your CSS just like in your templates.

Example:
```html
<template>
  <h1>Bonjour<h1>
</template>
<script>
  this.state.color = '#357';
</script>
<style>
  h1 {
    color: ${ this.color };
  }
</style>
```

will apply the `#357` color onto `h1`.


## Compiling

```sh
npx lego <source_path> <target_file_path>
```

Would compile the _source_path_ file or folder (recursively) into _target_file_path_ js file.

As mentioned before, when developing you probably want to watch for changes with the `-w`
option: `npx lego -w <source_path> <target_file_path>`


**source_path**: either a file or a directory (relative or absolute). If it's a directory, it will recursively read all the _.html_ files and compile them into the _target_file_.

**target_file_path**: (default: _components.js_) the path (relative or absolute) to a _.js_ file.
That file will be created and contain all the components.


## Naming a component

The name of the file will be the name of the component.

Example: _components/x-button.html_ will create `<x-button>` component.

However in some cases you may want to give your component a different name than the file.
To do so, you may give your template a name with the `name` attribute.

Example:

_components/x-button.html_:

```html
<template name="my-super-button"></template>
```

Will create a `<my-super-button>` component.

> Note that because it builds native web-components, the naming convention must respect
[the ones from the standards](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/#valid-custom-element-name) (lowercase, with a dash in the name, starting with a letter, …)


## Testing

## Running tests [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Polight/lego.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Polight/lego)

Just install node dev dependencies (`npm install`) and run the tests (`npm test`).


## Under the hood


### Native web-components

Because Lego is actual native web-components, all its native possibilities (like [slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#Adding_flexibility_with_slots)),
[:host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host)
and whatever exists or will exist are on board.


### Browser compatibility

Lego is based on native _customElements_.
[Support for customElement is spreading](https://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elementsv1) and
shall increase in time.

When building a web-app you may have control of the browsers.
If you're building a more general website you may need to increase the overall browser
compatibility and install the [custom-element polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/custom-elements).


### Dependencies

It is still fully compatible with native _custom elements_. No magic behind the scene,
no complexity, just a couple of useful methods to write native web-components easier.

Using a compiled component has no dependency, nothing extra injected in the browser.
Compiling depends on [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom).
